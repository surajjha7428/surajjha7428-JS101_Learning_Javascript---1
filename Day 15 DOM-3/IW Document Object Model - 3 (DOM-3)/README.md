### Problem Statement 
- Your app consists a form which contain 1 input tag and 1 select tag
    - Note : HTML tags are already in template.
- Form will take
    - Task Name
    - Priority (select tag)
- On form submit, display this data in form of table (thead is already in place just append to tbody)
- Input tags already in template, just finish script part.
- Each row should have 3 columns (td)
    - Task Name
    - Priority
- If priority is high, it should have red background, else green background.
- In each row, there should be a Favourite column and on clicking that do nothing, we will implement this - tomorrow.
- Make sure you follow all rules of forms.
